I talked about the exercise with Guy Katz, Yair Shemer, and Itay Tayar.

A program that plays hangman.
    In writing the code, we learned a division into small functions,
    working with an external function file and using complex loops.
A program that test the update_word_pattern function.


section C- q1:
To make sure that the function works properly, we will look at as many
 different and special cases as possible, and check that the function
 updates the pattern properly.
    ("word", "__r_", 'h')-
    Make sure that when the letter does not appear, the pattern does not change.
    ("aaaa", "____", 'a')-
    Makes sure that when the letter is all word, the pattern is updated to be the word itself.
    ("nnxaxsfx", "___a____", 'x')-
    Makes sure that when the letter appears several times, in different places, all places
    are updated to be the letter.
    ("abcde", "a_c_e", 'c')-
    Makes sure that when the letter appears in the word, it does not change.

section C- q2:
    To adapt the software to Hebrew, we will make the following changes:
    - The magic number CHAR_A will be set to 1488 (The serial number of a alef)
    - The magic number LETTERS_NUM will be set to 22 (Number of Hebrew letters)
